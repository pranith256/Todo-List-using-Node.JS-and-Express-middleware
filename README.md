Hi ,

This is a Todo-List application developed using Node.js with Express middleware. The database used here is MongoDB( used mongoose to connect the Database). 

This is a application which helps to keep track of the every day tasks. You can add the tasks based on the priorities, and remove them after finishing the respective tasks.
